Requirements
General

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
    Your files will be executed with MySQLdb version 2.0.x
    Your files will be executed with SQLAlchemy version 1.4.x
    All your files should end with a new line
    The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
    Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
    All your files must be executable
    The length of your files will be tested using wc
    All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
    All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
    All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
    A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
    You are not allowed to use execute with sqlalchemy
